\chapter{Using \acs{HPG-GdF} to investigate distribution of trastuzumab}
\label{ch:HPG2}

%\section{Preface}
%\SARi{There is no preface in the previous chapter - why here not there? Does it need a special heading?}
%In this chapter, we describe an application of the novel contrast agent \acs{HPG-GdF} in pre-clinical animal research on chemotherapies.
%The sections reproduced here in this chapter were part of a larger study exploring the distribution of trastuzumab, including exploring the microenvironments of \acs{HER2}-positive tumours and metastases including immunohistochemistry maps, 3D tissue models and dynamic imaging of tumour vasculature.
%This work was led by Dr.\ Jennifer Baker and the Andrew Minchinton lab in collaboration with the Reinsberg lab and published, with me as the fourth author in the peer-reviewed journal \emph{Clinical \& Experimental Metastasis} \deleted{with the manuscript} titled ``Heterogeneous distribution of trastuzumab in \acs{HER2}-positive xenografts and metastases: role of the tumor microenvironment''.

\section{Introduction}

Treatment options for patients with the aggressive \acs{HER2}-positive form of breast cancer continue to improve, though metastatic breast cancer remains a largely incurable disease.
Brain metastases are of particular importance in \acs{HER2}-positive breast cancer patients.
With improved treatments and prolonged survival, the incidence of brain metastases as the first evidence of relapse has increased~\cite{Seal:2012cn,Bria:2007gc}.
This effect has been attributed to the the blood-brain barrier (\acs{BBB}) creating a sanctuary site by preventing drug access~\cite{Kaplan:2014es,Lai:2004bd}.
Antibody-based therapeutics such as trastuzumab are proposed to have difficulty crossing the \acs{BBB} and therefore brain metastases evade drug activity~\cite{Seal:2012cn,Murrell:2015bz,Stemmler:2006}.
In addition to the \acs{BBB}, specific characteristics of the tumour microenvironment, beginning with a relative paucity of functional vessels, can thwart the access of drugs to their targets such that a population of under-exposed cells may survive and repopulate the tumour~\cite{Minchinton:2006gs}.
Our collaborators have shown that many small molecule cytotoxics have limited tumour tissue penetration in both \emph{in-vitro} and \emph{in-vivo} model systems due to difficulties with drug supply, flux through tissue, consumption or sequestration by cancer cells close to blood vessels~\cite{Kyle:2014cy,Kyle:2007ch,Huxham:2004hm,Kyle:2004fo,Kyle:1999kr}.

Macromolecular compounds such as \acs{MAb} face particular extravascular distribution difficulties due to their high molecular weights and target-binding affinity~\cite{Jain:2010ie,Chauhan:2011fi}.
The relatively slow distribution of \acs{MAb}s has been attributed to the binding site barrier hypothesis, where in the case of high affinity binding of the \acs{MAb} to antigen, \acs{MAb} distribution is limited by its binding in the presence of ample antigen~\cite{Juweid:1992ty}.
Data from our collaborators' lab (Dr. Andrew Minchinton) in the vector over-expressed MDA-435-LCC6 \acs{HER2} model showed that despite the ability of trastuzumab to distribute far from vessels in tumours with relatively even \acs{HER2} distribution, there persisted \acs{HER2}-positive tissue with poor access to trastuzumab after peak plasma exposures~\cite{Baker:2008ci}.
Staining heterogeneity is very striking at the vessel level, as trastuzumab is able to extravasate from only a subpopulation of perfused vessels.
Other groups have also demonstrated a limitation on the accumulation of trastuzumab in tumours, focusing on net tumour accumulation~\cite{Jain:2010ie,Chauhan:2011fi,Lee:2010gb}.

The ability of a drug to access and affect all its target cells is intuitively crucial for treatment success.
The relatively slow distribution of \acs{MAb}s through the interstitium in solid tumours is recognized, but the long half-life of \acs{MAb}s and prolonged plasma exposure is expected to ensure adequate time to access all the tissues in most treatment scenarios.
However, we have found that in addition to distributing slowly, \acs{MAb}s experience additional barriers, leaving some areas of tissue with inadequate drug exposure.
The aim for this study was to use \acs{HER2}-positive tumour and metastases models of cancer to determine potential limits to trastuzumab access that may represent a mechanism of resistance to targeted therapies.
%The microenvironments of \acs{HER2}-positive tumours and metastases are examined in detail using immunohistochemistry maps, 3D tissue models and dynamic imaging of tumour vasculature.

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Reagents}

Trastuzumab and bevacizumab (Roche, Genentech) were provided by the British Columbia Cancer Agency pharmacy; dilutions to 1-2 mg/ml were prepared in sterile 0.9\% NaCl before intra-peritoneal (\acs{i.p.}) injection.
%Human isotype control IgG1 (Sigma) was administered from similar concentrations.
Trastuzumab antibodies for use in combination with bevacizumab were tagged with fluorescent labels according to Alexa Fluor 546 Protein Labeling Kit (ThermoFisher) instructions.
%trastuzumab and IgG antibodies for use in combination with bevacizumab were tagged with fluorescent labels according to Alexa Fluor 546 Protein Labeling Kit (ThermoFisher) instructions.
Hypoxia marker pimonidazole (Hypoxyprobe) was administered at 60 mg/kg as an \acs{i.p.} injection 2 h prior to tissue harvest.
Fluorescent dye DiOC7(3) (Molecular Probes), 0.6 mg/ml dissolved in 75\% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide/25\% sterile H2O, was administered intravenously as a marker of vessel perfusion 5-min prior to tissue harvest~\cite{Trotter:1989cs}.

\subsection{Mice and tumours}

Female NOD-SCID mice weighing 20-28 g between 8 and 16 weeks of age were bred and maintained in our institutional pathogen free animal facility.
Mice were implanted with 60 day 17-$\beta$-estradiol pellets (Innovative Research of America) subcutaneously 3 days before implantation of \acs{BT474} or \acs{MDA-MB-361} tumours.
Tumors were implanted as single cell suspensions (2-10$\times 10^6$ cells) into the subcutaneous sacral region or into the inguinal mammary fat pads.
Metastases models were implanted as single cell suspensions (2-5$\times 10^5$ cells per implant) as \acs{i.v.} or \acs{i.p.} injections for SKOV3 or \acs{BT474} models, or as intra-cardiac injection for MDA-MDA-MB-231-BR-\acs{HER2} models, with animals euthanized a maximum of 23 days after implant.

\subsection{MRI}
MRI experiments were performed at the UBC MRI Research Centre on a 7T Bruker Biospec 70/30 scanner at room temperature with a combination volume (transmit)/surface (receive) coil.
\acs{DCE-MRI} data was collected as previously described~\cite{Baker:2015cob}.
Gadovist (Bayer Healthcare) was administered by \acs{i.v.} catheter as a 5 $\mu$L/g bolus dose from 60 mM solution.
Macromolecular contrast agent hyperbranched polyglycerol (\acs{HPG-GdF}, 583 kDa) was synthesized as previously described~\cite{Kainthan:2006ce,Saatchi:2012hc} and administered as a 6 $\mu$L/g bolus dose from 100 mg/mL (0.2 mM).
Regions of interest (ROI) were drawn on T$_2$-weighted \acs{RARE} images to outline the tumour using ImageJ (NIH) and all other MR analysis was performed using Python.
Area Under the Curves (AUC) for Gadovist was determined from the common injection time point to 60 s.
A two-parameter linear model was applied to characterize \acs{HPG-GdF} signal-intensity curves for fractional plasma volume (fPV) determined by the rapid increase at time of injection and for apparent permeability surface area product (aPS) calculated as the slope of later enhancement, as described earlier in section~\ref{hpgpaper1_methods}.
Both MR and histological modalities imaged slices in the plane perpendicular to an implanted fiducial marker tube to minimize angular differences between MR and histological image slices~\cite{Bains:2009hh}.

\subsection{Immunohistochemistry}
The general immunohistochemical procedure used has been previously reported~\cite{Baker:2008ci}.
Briefly, 10 $\mu$m tumour cryosections were air-dried, imaged for native DiOC7(3) or Alexa 546-tagged trastuzumab fluorescence, and fixed in 50\% (v/v) acetone/methanol for 10-min at room temperature.
Trastuzumab was visualized in sections using Alexa 546 goat anti-human secondary antibody (Invitrogen)
%trastuzumab and IgG were visualized in sections using Alexa 546 goat anti-human secondary antibody (Invitrogen).
\acs{HER2} was subsequently stained with 2.2$\times 10^{-3}$ mg/mL trastuzumab as a primary detection antibody and goat anti-human Alexa 546 secondary.
Additional staining was performed using antibodies to PECAM/CD31 (BD PharMingen), pimonidazole (hypoxprobe) collagen IV (\acs{CIV}, Gene Tex) and $\alpha$SMA (\acs{$\alpha$SMA}, Abcam).
Visualization of primary detection antibodies was done using Alexa fluorescence secondary antibodies of appropriate species using 488 nm, 647 nm and 750 nm wavelengths.
Nuclear density was stained using Hoechst 33342 (Thermofisher) and imaged at 380 nm.

\subsection{Image acquisition and analysis}
Sections were imaged as previously described~\cite{Kyle:2007ch} using a system of tiling adjacent microscope fields of view at a resolution of 0.75 $\mu$m/pixel.
Using ImageJ~\cite{Collins:2007jr} and user-supplied algorithms, images were superimposed and manually cropped to tumour tissue boundaries with staining artifacts and necrosis removed.
False color images were constructed in ImageJ by converting greyscale images to color and overlaying selected layers: trastuzumab (magenta), \acs{HER2} (blue or grey), Hoechst 33342 (grey), CD31 (blue), carbocyanine (cyan), pimonidazole (green) and \acs{$\alpha$SMA} or \acs{CIV} (red).
Positive fluorescent staining is reported as average intensity (range 1-255) for pimonidazole, trastuzumab and \acs{HER2}.
Perfused vascular density was determined by applying a threshold to CD31 and DiOC7(3) images, with neighboring positive pixels grouped as ``objects''; CD31 objects with a minimum 20\% overlap with DiOC7(3) objects were determined to be perfused vessels.
All image pixels were sorted based on their nearest perfused vessel and the average distance is reported as a repeatable measure of vascular density.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Measures of vascular density, architecture and function do not consistently correlate with heterogeneous patterns of trastuzumab distribution}

Significant inter-vessel heterogeneity in trastuzumab distribution is seen in orthotopic \acs{BT474} xenografts, with neighbouring patent vessels often showing variable amounts of trastuzumab bound to perivascular cells (Fig.~\ref{hpgpaper2:fig4}A), similar to previous findings in MDA-435-LCC6 vector-overexpressing \acs{HER2}-positive tumours~\cite{Baker:2008ci}.
Non-patent vessels (red arrows in Fig.~\ref{hpgpaper2:fig4}A) never have extravascular trastuzumab, suggesting intermittent perfusion is not a significant mechanism for reduced trastuzumab access.
The same inter-vessel heterogeneity is seen in \acs{MDA-MB-361} tumours where vascular function dynamics were further characterized by imaging the presence of Gadovist (Fig.~\ref{hpgpaper2:fig4}B).
Regions with greatest vascular function (largest \acs{AUC}$_{60}$ with Gadovist) do not consistently correspond to areas of greater trastuzumab distribution (red arrows in Fig.~\ref{hpgpaper2:fig4}B); this is also demonstrated quantitatively where matched slices were plotted for amount of bound trastuzumab and \acs{AUC}$_{60}$ (Gadovist).
The same sections were stained for vascular architectural markers \acs{$\alpha$SMA} and \acs{CIV} (both shown in red), neither of which exhibit a pattern of distribution similar to the presence or absence of trastuzumab (Fig.~\ref{hpgpaper2:fig4}B).

Some regions are high for Gadovist uptake, reflecting high vascular function, but these do not consistently correspond with regions of high trastuzumab distribution in histology sections.
No correlation was found between Gadovist AUC and trastuzumab in matched image slices obtained from multiple tumours.
Similarly, neither \acs{$\alpha$SMA} nor \acs{CIV} are present to a greater degree proximal to vessels with or without trastuzumab bound to perivascular cells.

\subsection{Dynamic vascular permeability and blood volume measurements do not consistently relate to patterns of trastuzumab distribution}

The histological measure of perfusion using carbocyanine is a useful indication of vessel patency, however it is static and therefore its interpretation is limited.
The role of vascular function on trastuzumab distribution was further investigated using dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) of a high molecular weight contrast agent, \acs{HPG-GdF} (MW 583 kDa) (Fig.~\ref{hpgpaper2:fig6}).
As previously described, repeat imaging of contrast agent presence in the tumours is analysed and the initial appearance of \acs{HPG-GdF} reflects \acs{fPV} and its accumulation over time indicates the apparent permeability surface area (aPS)~\cite{Baker:2015cob}.
Tumours were excised immediately after imaging; corresponding histological sections are compared to the DCE-MRI derived parameter maps.
\acs{BT474} tumours have microregionally variable levels of both \acs{fPV} and \acs{aPS}, each exhibiting regions of distinction.
Regions of high \acs{fPV} are well matched by histological images of carbocyanine that indicate areas of very high perfusion but some of these regions do not have any significant accumulation of trastuzumab.
The reverse can also be found, where regions with relatively low \acs{fPV} correspond to high trastuzumab.
Similarly, there are some significant trastuzumab accumulation areas that have relatively low \acs{aPS} while some high \acs{aPS} values correspond to areas with relatively low trastuzumab.
Examples of good or bad correlation between vascular function and trastuzumab distribution are highlighted with arrows and suggest that neither of the MRI-derived parameters consistently or adequately explain microregional distribution of trastuzumab.

\section{Discussion}

%This study has shown direct evidence of poor trastuzumab access to metastases of the brain in a preclinical model.
%Small clusters of cells that are immediately surrounded by highly perfused brain, liver or lung tissues may remain incompletely or in some cases totally unbound for trastuzumab.
%Some avascular metastases of the brain may be outside the \acs{BBB} and therefore have poor access to trastuzumab, while larger lesions with active angiogenesis and blood vessel support may have a blood-tumour barrier (BTB) with greater trastuzumab delivery, however we have shown that microregional distribution of trastuzumab can remain highly heterogeneous and incomplete even when delivered by vessels within \acs{HER2}-positive lesions.
%Our data are in agreement with other studies evaluating the permeability of brain metastases, which have found no correlation between metastases size, vessel density, aggressiveness or morphology and their permeability~\cite{Murrell:2015bz,Adkins:2016il}.
%Mittapalli et al.\ have used mathematical modelling and MRI data to show a limit in the vascular pore size of MDA-MB-231-BR-\acs{HER2} metastases that would preclude access to \acs{MAb}s including trastuzumab~\cite{Mittapalli:2017iu}.
%Other groups have also shown poor trastuzumab access in this model~\cite{Nounou:2016kl,TerrellHall:2017gu}.
%Trastuzumab has been detected in larger brain lesions in murine models~\cite{LewisPhillips:2017jj} where higher systemic doses of the \acs{MAb} were required to achieve anti-cancer efficacy seen for tumours grown in the mammary fat pad.
%Accumulation over time has also been noted in patient metastases including those of the brain, where labeled antibodies were used for diagnostic purposes using PET~\cite{Dijkers:2010gc,Kurihara:2015kc}.
%It is unknown if human tumours or metastases exhibit the same barriers to \acs{MAb} access.
%As we have shown, access of trastuzumab to metastases and the distribution within can be highly heterogeneous, and is likely to be highly model and patient specific.
%Ultimately, a majority of patients treated with trastuzumab eventually experience progression and relapse.
%The rate of brain metastases has increased for \acs{HER2}-positive patients following treatment with trastuzumab, suggesting the \acs{MAb} therapeutic is less effective for tumours `behind' the \acs{BBB} than in metastases elsewhere such as the liver and lung~\cite{Stemmler:2006}.
%Here we show direct evidence of poor trastuzumab access to \acs{HER2}-positive brain metastases and suggest that this confirms non-uniform access of \acs{MAb}s to cancers and metastases may be driving a significant portion of resistance to their effects.

Using tumour mapping analysis and \acs{DCE-MRI} we examined the impacts of tumour blood vessel architecture, vascular function and the tumour microenvironment on the patterns of distribution of trastuzumab in primary and metastatic models.
Our collaborators have observed that even when trastuzumab does have access to tumour tissues, the pattern of distribution is highly heterogeneous, similar to their previous work in a vector-overexpressing \acs{HER2}-positive breast cancer model~\cite{Baker:2008ci}.
Other groups demonstrating a limitation on the accumulation of trastuzumab in preclinical tumours have focused on net tumour accumulation and suggest that a major limitation to \acs{MAb} distribution is their difficulty distributing through the solid tumour tissue in the extravascular space~\cite{Jain:2010ie,Chauhan:2011fi,Lee:2010gb}.
In humans, \acs{MAb}s have a long half-life and are administered for many months.
The pharmacokinetic parameters of \acs{MAb}s are therefore thought to likely accommodate relatively slow distribution of \acs{MAb}s through the interstitium~\cite{Chauhan:2011fi,Thurber:2012dd}.
However, 3D tissue-disc data from the Minchinton lab shows trastuzumab is able to diffuse relatively well through tumour tissues \emph{in vivo} in conditions of poor convective flow similar to an environment with high interstitial fluid pressure in vivo~\cite{Baker:2018ex}.
Neither is trastuzumab distribution limited by tight binding to antigen proximal to vessels as suggested by the binding-site barrier hypothesis~\cite{Juweid:1992ty}, as it reaches distances $>150 \mu$m from sources within 24h despite high \acs{HER2} expression~\cite{Baker:2018ex}.
This distance is similar to the diffusion limit for oxygen, therefore most tumour tissues are within this 150 $\mu$m range of a blood vessel and could be expected to have adequate exposure.
These data suggest that neither the binding site barrier hypothesis nor high interstitial fluid pressure adequately explain microregional variation in trastuzumab binding.
Given the incomplete access of trastuzumab seen in our models, other vessel- and tissue-level barriers appear to limit its distribution in the tumour microenvironment.

%One barrier to \acs{MAb} distribution appears to be the presence of tight junctions, labeled using ZO-1.
%However, these continuous barriers are not seen in vivo where inter-vessel heterogeneity occurs and even neighboring perfused vessels exhibit dramatic differences in the amount of bound drug on their perivascular cells.
Vascular maturity and architecture has also been attributed to poor drug access~\cite{Goel:2011ku}, however, no correlation between markers for \acs{$\alpha$SMA} or \acs{CIV} and the relative distribution of trastuzumab has been found.
Higher doses and longer exposures do lead to higher numbers of vessels with perivascular trastuzumab, suggesting that some degree of intermittent perfusion or very poorly permeable vessels impact the observed microregional heterogeneity.
Non-perfused vessels have not been observed to have trastuzumab on perivascular cells, which suggests intermittent perfusion is an unlikely mechanism for observed inter-vessel heterogeneity.
Dynamic measurements of perfusion and permeability derived from DCE-MR imaging of high molecular weight contrast agent \acs{HPG-GdF} (583 kDa) suggest the intuitive relationship between vascular function and drug access is important, but does not consistently explain the heterogeneous patterns of drug distribution seen.
Areas of highly perfused tissue marked by carbocyanine in histological sections correspond to areas of high perfusion and/or permeability in MRI.
However, these tumour areas of high vascular function described in both imaging modalities may or may not have bound trastuzumab.
Similarly, regions with substantial amounts of bound trastuzumab do not necessarily correspond to areas of high perfusion or permeability measured using \acs{aPS} and \acs{fPV}.
HPG-GdF-derived parameters \acs{fPV} and \acs{aPS} arise under conditions that are closer to a permeability-limited regime than standard low-molecular weight contrast agents.
However, in the highly chaotic vascular environment of tumours we can still expect these MR-derived parameters of vascular function to not be completely independent of each other.

% All \emph{in vivo} models investigated were found to be sensitive to the effects of bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody that binds VEGF-A and decreases vascular permeability~\cite{Ferrara:2005bk}.
% In our xenograft studies we see a dramatic reduction in the accumulation of trastuzumab in tumours when following pre-treatment with bevacizumab.
% The majority of tumour blood vessels cease to have extravasated trastuzumab bound to perivascular cells.
% These detailed images of the microenvironment highlighting reduced distribution at the vessel level agree with previous studies showing average reductions in trastuzumab delivery to the whole tumour~\cite{Arjaans:2013dv,Pastuskovas:2012dx}.
% In some cases VEGF ablation changes tumour vasculature, either the density or the fraction of perfused or mature vessels and the resulting overall function of tumour vasculature, but did not do so measurably in these tumours where neither the proportion of perfused vessels nor the amount of tumour hypoxia changed.

% The clinical impact of combination treatments is unclear, largely due to the difficulty in measuring drug distribution directly.
% Addition of bevacizumab did not improve outcomes for metastatic breast cancer patients being treated with docetaxel and trastuzumab~\cite{Gianni:2013hz}.
% Overall, poor clinical results have been found when combining VEGF ablation therapies with trastuzumab (reviewed in~\cite{Sledge:2015gb}).
% The potential risks of combining \acs{MAb}s and anti-angiogenic treatments have been recognized, and many publications and reviews in the pre-clinical and clinical fields of have called for investigations regarding optimal treatment and scheduling regimens for these combinations~\cite{Sledge:2015gb,Jain:2013jc,Chauhan:2012bm,Olson:2013go,Spector:2009gj,VanderVeldt:2014ii,LAM:2013dt}.

New strategies that are able to more effectively target and kill cancer cells, particularly metastatic disease, are urgently required.
Efforts to vary antigen-binding affinities and the size of \acs{MAb} fragments have been explored to improve their distribution through the extravascular compartment~\cite{Jain:2010ie,Chauhan:2011fi}.
Our data highlight the importance of also considering access of antibodies to target tumour tissues and whether microregional distribution of \acs{MAb} therapeutics may be affected when combined with vascular damaging agents or when targeting occult metastases.
Improvements to \acs{MAb} anti-cancer activity could be made in selection of combination therapies and the design of treatment schedules, as well as in the design of novel targeted drugs.
Efforts to examine these phenomena in the clinic would be of significant interest.

\section{Conclusions}
We have shown evidence for poor distribution and access of trastuzumab in preclinical tumours through direct visualization of bound drug, with particular implications for metastatic tumours.
Our data suggest that the tumour microenvironment and tissue- and vessel-level barriers to drug distribution could effectively limit access of the drug to all its target cells.
These effects appear to be more important than slow interstitial distribution resulting from high interstitial fluid pressures or high binding affinity to \acs{HER2}.
Further, administering trastuzumab in combination with vascular disrupting agents could significantly impact its activity via reducing access.
