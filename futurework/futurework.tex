\section{Introduction}

The work presented in this chapter provides a blueprint to continue the \acs{dOE-MRI} project and explore several avenues of research.
The level of maturity of each section varies and all attempts have been made to motivate and guide the reader through the methods, results, and their implications.

\section{Group ICA}

One of the principal limitations of \acs{ICA} is that it ``does not naturally generalize to a method suitable for drawing inferences about groups of subjects~\cite{Calhoun:2009jr}.
In this thesis, we developed a quantification method to mitigate this issue by comparing component weighting factor strength after normalization (Section~\ref{sec:correctionfactor}).
Calhoun et al., has reviewed several methods for analyzing multiple subjects within a cohort using \acs{ICA} have been proposed~\cite{Calhoun:2009jr}.
The approach that is most relevant for the data collected for the experiments presented in this thesis (section~\ref{sec:B20_expt1}) is spatial concatenation~\cite{Calhoun:2001jx}.
Briefly, cohort data for Group ICA was constructed by concatenating all 16 slices from the 17 subjects together in the z-dimension.
Figure~\ref{groupICAschematic} compares Group ICA to the standard ICA technique described in Chapter~\ref{ch:oemri1}.
The same deflation-based \acs{FastICA} (python package \texttt{scikit.sklearn}~v0.17.1) was used to analyze the data.
To ensure the cyclic behaviour of the T$_1$ weighted signal intensity corresponding to the gas challenge appeared in only one component, the number of independent components was set to 9.
Application of \acs{ICA} to the spatially concatenated data produced a single oxygen-enhancing component that matched the temporal pattern of the gas cycling paradigm in all 17 animals (Figure~\ref{groupICA1}). 
This component appears to be smoother than typical extracted oxygen enhancing components because it represents the group response rather than the individual features that exist in each mouse that responds somewhat differently.

   \caption{Comparison of the standard ICA technique and Group ICA. The main difference is in the pre-processing of the MRI data comprising spatial coordinates ($x,y,z$) and temporal information ($t$). Group ICA datasets are prepared by spatially concatenating all animals together ($n$). The output of the ICA techniques also differs: in standard ICA each application produces a set of independent components whereas in Group ICA only a single set of independent components is produced.
   \label{groupICAschematic}}
\end{figure}

Upon selection of the single oxygen enhancing component, reshaping the resultant weighting-factor maps to the original matrix size provided inter-subject comparable data.
Final normalized \acs{dOE-MRI} maps were obtained by dividing each pixel of the component map for each animal with the mean signal-intensity over time of the corresponding pixel in the dOE-MRI scan.
Corresponding \acs{dOE-MRI} are comparable to the methods presented in Chapter~\ref{ch:oemri3} and conclusions of the B20 effect still hold with this analysis method.
One major disadvantage of applying \acs{ICA} only once to multiple animals is that the extracted component averages out any individual features.

\section{Further investigation of the characteristic oxygen response curve}

In this thesis a limited number of tumours models were studied (SCCVII, BT-474, and HCT-116) so it was difficult to generalize whether modeling of the oxygen response curve is characteristic of the tumour environment or model. 
In section~\ref{sec:lognormalfitting_results} we observed that $\sigma_f$ in the SCCVII tumours discriminated between the rapidly growing SCCVII tumours and the other two models.
Further work should include characterizing additional tumour models with varying tumour microenvironments, and also comparison of the oxygen signal decay curves (i.e. when the gas is switched back to room air) as well as the enhancement curves.

%\subsection{Extracting the cycling component via \acs{ICA} is independent of number of components}
\label{sec:numComponents}
Another interesting feature of the \acs{ICA} extraction process is that for our application, the number of components prescribed rarely matters in separating out the oxygen-responsive component.
\acs{dOE-MRI} maps from \acs{ICA} applied serially after varying the number of components ($m$) from 3 to 12 are shown in Figure~\ref{numComponents}.
The component of the signal that corresponds to the T$_1$W signal intensity increase due to the cycling oxygen is quite prominent and independent of the number of components selected.
Two examples are shown, with a low and high degree of variability measured in the extracted components.
It is currently an open question how the presence or absence of noise affects the extraction process. 
In any event, it is instructive to consider the best-case and worst-case scenarios for the independent component as it may have implications when performing fits.
In both cases, the corresponding \acs{dOE-MRI} maps show the same O$_2$-positive and O$_2$-negative regions.

   \caption{Two animals were selected to explore the effect of the number of components ($m$) on the \acs{dOE-MRI} maps. This analysis is presented to ensure that the number of components selected had no bearing on the extracted ICA component. The two animals presented here were selected to exhbit the full range of variability in extracted components. The low variability example shows no discernible difference in the extracted component anywhere from $m=3$ to $m=12$. The high variability example shows considerably more noise in the extracted component, but the same overall trend. The corresponding \acs{dOE-MRI} maps for both the low variability and high variability examples show almost no difference in the oxygenation maps.}

\section{dOE-MRI maps of 10 consecutive air/\texorpdfstring{O$_2$}{O2} switches are stable}

The presence of hypoxia in tumours is known to exhibit microregional and temporal heterogeneity.
The process of cells going through periods of oxygen-starvation and then subsequently being re-oxygenated has been termed cyclic hypoxia~\cite{Dewhirst:2009de,Bayer:2011js, Bayer:2012kb}.
A leading cause of cycling hypoxia is the variable flux of red blood cells through the abnormal tumour vasculature on time scales of minutes to hours.
There is some evidence of cycling hypoxia in our data as there are clear mismatches between pimonidazole staining and perfusion markers (Figure~\ref{fig_perfusion}).
The SCCVII tumour model has specifically been shown to be afflicted by cycling hypoxia as early as  1986~\cite{Chaplin:1986iz}.
It is therefore not surprising that \acs{dOE-MRI} is sensitive to these changes in this tumour model, and provides the first non-invasive data suggesting cycling hypoxia on the relatively short timeline of less than 15 minutes.
The clinical importance of intermittent hypoxia is unclear largely due to poor availability of techniques to measure it in humans~\cite{Michiels:2016hv}. 
Recent work on measuring cycling hypoxia in patients using R$_2^*$~\cite{Panek:2017ge} shows that interest in this phenomenon continues.

Despite the presence of cycling hypoxia in many regions of the SCCVII tumours, O$_2$-enhancing regions in \acs{dOE-MRI} maps are generally in agreement with well perfused areas of histology images.
In particular, concentrated oxygen-responsive regions within a \acs{dOE-MRI} map correspond to highly vascular, perfused regions in matching histology images.
Voxels anti-correlated with the O$_2$ stimulus (O$_2$ refractory, green) typically correspond with pimonidazole staining but there are instances of mismatch (Figures~\ref{fig_sccvii}, ~\ref{fig_hct116}, and ~\ref{fig_perfusion}).
In addition to cycling hypoxia, there may be possible mismatch between the sensitivities of pimonidazole and dOE-MRI and other oxygen sensing modalities (described in \cite{Horsman:2012kw}).
Success of \acs{dOE-MRI} will ultimately depend on its validation as a clinically useful measure of tumour hypoxia.

To assess this phenomenon, a pilot study was carried out to determine whether this cycling hypoxia can be measured with \acs{dOE-MRI}.
In a small pilot cohort of SCCVII xenografts mice ($n=2$), rather than the standard protocol of three cycles of air-oxygen switches, ten consecutive air-oxygen switches were used.
\acs{ICA} was applied to each cycle of the sequences separately (as described in section~\ref{fig_repeatability}).
Figure~\ref{longcycles} shows the results from a tumour including a \acs{dOE-MRI} map (\ref{longcycles}A), a standard deviation map (\ref{longcycles}B), and a coefficient of variation map (\ref{longcycles}C).
The standard deviation and coefficient of variation maps are surrogate measures of cycling hypoxia as they highlight regions of the tumour that show the highest degree of deviation or variation over the ten cycles.
It is expected that if cycling hypoxia exists, these measures would show regions where it is apparent. 
If cycling hypoxia is not present, then the two parameter maps would be largely feature-less.
In this case, there appears to be little evidence for cycling hypoxia as the \acs{dOE-MRI} maps are fairly consistent from cycle to cycle.
Unfortunately, these results remain un-validated because we were not able to assess cycling hypoxia using histology.
One way to assess cycling hypoxia using histology is to use two separate hypoxia stains (such as EF5 and pimonidazole) and inject them intravenously 30-60 minutes apart.
Imaging the two stains and mapping the differences could confirm the presence or absence of cycling hypoxia. 
A subsequent experiment where the \acs{dOE-MRI} analysis is repeated in more animals alongside the dual hypoxia histological markers would help confirm this finding.

The voxel-wise standard deviation (B) and coefficient of variation (C) of the ten \acs{dOE-MRI} maps shows some variability at the top of the tumour as well as on the mid-right of the tumour.}

\section{Exploring the link between perfusion and oxygenation}

One SCCVII and one HCT-116 tumour-bearing mouse were catheterized and injected with 30-mM solution of Gd-DTPA for \acs{DCE-MRI} at a rate of 1~mL/min using a power injector at a dose of 5~$\mu$L/g.

Signal intensity timecourse from the \acs{DCE-MRI} data was first normalized to the mean signal intensity pre-injection.
A numerical integration technique that relies on quadratic polynomials to approximate functions (Simpson's Rule, scipy.integrate.simps) was used to calculate the area under the first 60 seconds (\acs{AUC}$_{60}$) of the normalized signal intensity enhancement curve.
A binary ground-truth perfusion map was constructed by classifying all voxels with AUC$_{60} > 0$ as perfused and everything else as unperfused.

Where \acs{dOE-MRI} and DCE-MRI scans were acquired in the same SCCVII and HCT-116 tumour-bearing mice,  maps of oxygenation status were compared to \acs{AUC}$_{60}$ perfusion maps, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig_perfusion}.
Mean \acs{AUC}$_{60}$ for the well-perfused SCCVII tumour was 22 $\pm$ 16 \%$\cdot$s and for the comparatively poorly perfused HCT-116 tumour was 7$\pm$ 7 \%$\cdot$s.
Well-oxygenated O$_2$-positive regions generally correspond to perfused, high \acs{AUC}$_{60}$ areas in both SCCVII and HCT-116 tumours.
A large patch of necrosis, as identified in histological section, in the HCT-116 tumour was also extremely poorly perfused; such large patches of necrosis were not present in the SCCVII tumour.

Large regions marked as purple in the \acs{dOE-MRI} maps are O$_2$-positive and also correspond to regions that have high \acs{AUC}$_{60}$ values (yellow). Green or O$_2$-negative regions from the \acs{dOE-MRI} map are often consistent with unperfused regions in the \acs{AUC}$_{60}$ (black), but there are regions of mismatch. Histology images stained with pimonidazole (green) and CD31 (purple) are shown for corresponding sections.

\section{Expanding \texorpdfstring{\acs{dOE-MRI}}{dOE-MRI} to include \texorpdfstring{T$_2^*$}{T2*}}
\label{futurework:expandingdOEMRI_T2*}
%%% from the grant

For a variety of reasons, the past 5-10 years have seen a gradual resurgence of oxygen-enhanced MRI and renewed interest to refine and better understand the mechanism of action.
One important strategy to elucidate the mechanism of oxygen as a contrast agent is to rely on the \acs{BOLD} effect. 
Little et al.\ have recently shown that simultaneous acquisition of T$_1$ and T$_2^*$ images improves the specificity of oxygen-enhanced MRI~\cite{Little:2018iu}.
Here we outline how our technique using \acs{ICA} can be expanded to include T$_2^*$ imaging, and what the additional information will be used for.

T$_2^*$ imaging would utilize the Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (\acs{BOLD}) effect, which can measure shifts in hemoglobin saturation through changes in T$_2^*$ and therefore assess tumour perfusion without the need for injectable contrast agents. 
Applying an oxygen challenge also shifts the haemoglobin saturation and, thus, the T$_2^*$ signal. 
The expected behaviour of a joint change in T$_1$ and T$_2^*$ in response to a gas challenge, and how this can be interpreted to reflect tumour oxygenation is based on data from recent work by Little~\cite{Little:2018iu} and Waterton et al.~\cite{OConnor:2019fc}. 

The altered T$_2^*$ provides a robust measure of areas with functioning vasculature. 
Subsequently, \acs{dOE-MRI} maps can be masked using the $\Delta$T$_2^*$ maps to exclude unperfused regions resulting in a completely endogenous technique to assess tumour oxygenation. 
OE-MRI T$_1$-weighted signal more directly reflects oxygen amounts in plasma and tissues and is more applicable for measuring tumour oxygenation as it relates to radiotherapy.
Without sacrificing the information obtained from T$_1$-weighted signal intensity in our current work, we propose to extract both T$_1$-weighted signal intensity and T$_2^*$ simultaneously using a dynamic, multi-gradient echo in place of a dynamic FLASH sequence. 
The cycling gas challenge in combination with \acs{ICA} improvement to T$_1$-weighted oxygen-enhanced imaging will also be applicable to T$_2^*$.

A multi-gradient echo (\acs{MGE}) sequence is ideal to extend our current T$_1$ based dOE-MRI technique to also acquire dynamic T$_2^*$ weighted data.
This is because initial echoes from an \acs{MGE} sequence are T$_1$ weighted and as the echo time increases, the images become more T$_2^*$ weighted. 
The T$_1$w \acs{dOE-MRI} map can be calculated from the signal intensity of the first gradient echo image (minimal echo time TE$\approx$2.25 ms). 
The T$_2^*$ \acs{dOE-MRI} map can be created by applying \acs{ICA} to the mono-exponentially fitted multi-gradient echo data at each repetition. 
Figure~\ref{MGE_schematic} outlines our approach to obtain T$_1$- and T$_2^*$-based \acs{dOE-MRI} maps from a single multi-gradient echo sequence. 
While the temporal resolution of the multi-gradient echo technique is lower, the data quality of the T$_1$w \acs{dOE-MRI} map is not compromised until subsampling exceeds six times the original temporal resolution when compared to that obtained with a \acs{FLASH} sequence (see Figure~\ref{sec:interleave}).

\subsection{Independent Vector Analysis}

\acs{ICA} can be extended if the data being analyzed is multi-dimensional beyond temporal and spatial coordinates, for instance, T$_1$ and T$_2^*$ weighted images.
Independent vector analysis (\acs{IVA}) is the technique that permits the increased statistical power of two independent parameters acquired simultaneously.
It is a vector-based blind-source estimation first used in \acs{fMRI} applications~\cite{Lee:2008dc}. 
The problem solved by \acs{IVA} is that observations that are vector quantities (i.e. data consisting of one T$_1$-weighted signal and one T$_2^*$ value derived from the exponential fit) are explained by a mixture of source vectors~\cite{Lee:2008dc}:

\begin{equation}
x_i = \sum_{j}^{L} a_{ij} \circ s_j
\end{equation}

where $\circ$ indicates an element-wise product. 
An algorithm suggested by Rafique et al.\ in 2016 solves the implementation problem and makes it available as FastIVA~\cite{Rafique:2016cf}.
It would be worthwhile to explore \acs{IVA} as an extension to \acs{ICA} once the T$_1$ and T$_2^*$ weighted data is acquired.

\section{Conclusions}

The \acs{dOE-MRI} method presented in the preceding chapters presents significant improvements to the sensitivity, speed, and applicability of existing \acs{OE-MRI} techniques. 
We showed that small changes in T$_1$W signal intensity arising from cycling respiratory challenges can be separated robustly using \acs{ICA}. 
Traditional quantitative T$_1$-mapping techniques have longer imaging times and are impractical for \acs{OE-MRI} due to \acs{SNR} and time constraints.
\acs{dOE-MRI} with \acs{ICA} is clinically translatable as the sequence acquisition is relatively short and most centres already have access to dynamic T$_1$W MRI acquisitions that many patients already routinely receive. 
Therefore \acs{dOE-MRI} is an exciting, non-invasive and widely available technique for assessing tumour oxygenation that could provide a crucial tool in the field of radiation oncology and in the development of treatments targeting the tumour microenvironment.
We look forward to the opening of exciting avenues by \acs{dOE-MRI} in the areas of drug development, patient stratification, and treatment monitoring.
