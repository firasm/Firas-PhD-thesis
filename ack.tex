\chapter{Acknowledgments}

This work would not be possible without the tireless commitment and mentoring by my supervisor, Dr. Stefan Reinsberg.
Dr. Baker was also instrumental in helping run, plan, and provide support for all of the work presented here. 
Members of my supervisory committee, Drs. Kozlowski, Laule, and Minchinton were excellent sources of advice, feedback, guidance, and general project direction. 
Particular thanks to Dr. Kozlowski for supporting and organizing weekly lab meetings giving me and other trainees to give and get honest feedback on preliminary work - I learned a tonne through these meetings.

Finally, a huge thanks goes to my family, and my wife who has supported and humoured me through my meanderings over the course of my PhD.
