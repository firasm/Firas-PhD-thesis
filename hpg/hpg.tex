\chapter[MRI and histology of vascular function in xenografts using HPG]{Multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging and histology of vascular function in xenografts using macromolecular contrast agent hyperbranched polyglycerol (HPG-GdF)}
\label{ch:HPG}

\section{Introduction}

The vascular network in tumor tissue is abnormal, often resulting in vessels that have variable flow rates and high permeability relative to blood vessels in normal tissue~\cite{McDonald:2002ut}.
Dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) is a useful tool for non-invasively assessing tumor vasculature by imaging and measuring concentrations of contrast agent (CA) delivered to tumors by the vessels (2-4).
The appeal of a dynamic, non-invasive approach for measuring tumor vascular function in the clinic is clear.
Such data is applicable in the field of assessing treatment response for vascular targeting therapies~\cite{OConnor:2012ie,Barrett:2006jx,Leach:2003fy}.
In addition to utility as a treatment biomarker, vascular function data may be able to predict which tumors are likely to respond to therapy~\cite{DeBruyne:2012cq,Kelly:2011cf,Bains:2009hh}, or which regions or tumors have greater heterogeneity in their microenvironment~\cite{OConnor:2011jm,Alic:2011hw}.
The issue of limited access for anticancer drugs in solid tumors is significant~\cite{Minchinton:2006gs}, particularly given the efforts to create nanoparticle therapeutics that target the tumor via the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect~\cite{Jain:2001uf,Chauhan:2011fi}.
A translatable imaging protocol and suitable contrast agent that yields meaningful, reproducible biomarkers of vascular function could be widely useful in these areas of cancer research.

Low molecular weight (MW) Gd(III)-based, chelated CAs such as Gadovist (MW = 605 Da) exhibit short half-lives and rapid renal clearance~\cite{Weinmann:1984gv}.
With the exception of brain tissue containing a functional blood-brain barrier, low MW Gd agents currently in clinical use diffuse across the vascular endothelium in most normal and neoplastic tissues.
Therefore, a well-established shortcoming of low MW contrast agents is the difficulty of attributing local signal enhancement specifically to either vascular perfusion or vessel permeability.
The ability to characterize physiologically relevant biomarkers of vascular function is desirable for studying the effects of anti-angiogenic treatments in tumors (described in a comprehensive review regarding DCE-MRI and anti-vascular therapies in cancer~\cite{OConnor:2012ie}).
Development and application of macromolecular contrast agents (MCAs) attempt to improve upon DCE-MRI assessment of vascular function by relying on the primarily intravascular nature of MCAs.
High MW contrast agents and therapeutics unable to diffuse across the endothelium selectively extravasate from large pores and inter-endothelial cell gaps that characterize the abnormal vessels in the tumor microenvironment~\cite{McDonald:2002ut,Hashizume:2000bq}.
MCAs commonly used in cancer research include albumin, dextran polymers, and PAMAM or PPI dendrimers conjugated with DTPA/DOTA-Gd3+ chelates as described by Tang et al.~\cite{Tang:2013fi}.
The size of MCAs in use or under development ranges considerably, but may be as small as a 90 kDa albumin conjugate, or one of a range of dextran sizes~\cite{Barrett:2006jx}.
Particles less than 5 nm in size have been found to leak rapidly from tumor vasculature, whereas those in the 5-8nm range are limited to leaking from hyperpermeable vessels; those greater than 8nm are thought to have minimal leakage~\cite{Kobayashi:2004vq,Sato:2001tt}.
The most commonly used MCAs in preclinical research are albumin based; however, these are not translatable to the clinic due to immunogenicity concerns~\cite{Ogan:1987tg}.
Signal enhancement is linked to contrast agent concentration within the tumor blood vessels at early time points after injection for MCAs that remain intravascular, such that tumor plasma volumes (Vp) can be determined.
Rates of MCA leakage from hyperpermeable vessels may then be modeled to evaluate permeability, since extravascular accumulation of the agents will manifest as increased enhancement in repeat images~\cite{Ogan:1987tg,Turetschek:2004bw}.
This analysis is dependent on the assumption that the MCAs have unidirectional flow and do not leak back into the plasma, and that the concentration in the plasma is constant, creating a permeabilitylimited environment.
In this study we investigated a multi-modal, high MW contrast agent, HPG-GdF: hyperbranched polyglycerol (HPG) molecules doubly labeled with Gd-DOTA and a fluorescent marker.
HPGs are soluble, globular, asymmetrical, have low immunogenicity and are highly biocompatible molecules with low polydispersity~\cite{Saatchi:2012hc,Kainthan:2006ce,Saatchi:2012gc}.
HPG has been previously tested as a human serum substitute~\cite{Kainthan:2008ek} and as a drug delivery vehicle due to its versatility as a chemical, such that drugs, Gd chelates, fluorescent and radiolabels may all be attached to it~\cite{Shenoi:2013id}.
Many other MCAs, including Gd-albumin, are highly viscous, which can limit the applicable dose~\cite{Imranulhaq:2012ij}.
The MW of HPG-GdF is tunable to required applications, and a biodegradable version of HPG is also available for potential use~\cite{Shenoi:2013id}.
The HPG-GdF described in this study is 583kDa and 8-10nm in diameter; synthesis of HPG-GdF has previously been described~\cite{Saatchi:2012hc}.
A significant advantage of HPG-GdF is that it is a multi-modal agent, with both fluorescent and Gd-chelate labels that permit histological validation of observations made using MRI, including determining the degree to which the agent extravasates from the vasculature.
Previous studies have also used 111In as a SPECT label with utility for biodistribution studies~\cite{Saatchi:2012hc}.
In this work, we employed comprehensive histological methods to investigate the microregional location of HPG-GdF in two human colorectal xenograft models, and used this information to interrogate observations made non-invasively using DCE-MR imaging of the same agent in the same tumors.

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Mice and tumors}

Female NOD/SCID mice were bred and housed in institutional animal facilities; experiments in this study were approved by the Animal Care Committee of the University of British Columbia.
Fiducial markers were constructed of PE-50 polyethylene tubing (inner diameter, 0.58mm) and filled with paraffin wax and saline, creating an MR-visible interface~\cite{Bains:2009hh}.
Marker tubes were implanted subcutaneously in the sacral region of mice, in a craniocaudal orientation, 2 days prior to subcutaneous implantation of tumors.
Both histological and MR modalities imaged slices in the plane perpendicular to the marker tube to minimize angular differences between serial MR image slices obtained over multiple sessions, and for corresponding cryosections in histological processing.
HCT116 or HT29 human colorectal carcinoma cells obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) were implanted near the fiducial tubes such that the tumors grew around the tubes.
Tumors were used when diameters reached 8-12 mm.
Mice were anaesthetized with isoflurane for the duration of imaging sessions.
Animals were positioned supine on the custom surface coil apparatus fitted with a lid lined by a temperature-controlled, water-filled heating blanket.
Body temperature and respiration rate were monitored throughout imaging.
Following their final scan animals were administered a 35 $\mu$L intravenous dose of 0.6 mg/mL carbocyanine (DioC7(3); Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA) in 75\% dimethylsulfoxide as a fluorescent dye indicator of vessel perfusion in histological measures, and euthanized 5min after injection.
Some animals received HPG-GdF and tumors were collected at early time points for histological analysis only, with no MR-imaging.
Tumors were embedded and frozen vertically in optimum cutting temperature medium (OCT; Tissue-TEK) using their fiducial markers for guidance.

\subsection{Contrast agents and dosage}

Hyperbranched polyglycerol (HPG-GdF) (Fig.~\ref{hpgpaper1:fig1}): 583 kDa HPG was synthesized at the University of British Columbia (D. Brookâ€™s laboratory, Department of Chemistry) with a narrow polydispersity of PDI = 1.01 by ring-opening multibranching polymerization of glycidol using dioxane as the reaction medium, according to a published procedure~\cite{Kainthan:2006ce}.
HPG was derivatized with p-NH2-benzyl-DOTA (Macrocyclics, Dallas, TX, USA) at 20$\mu$g Gd per mg HPG and tagged with Alexa Fluor 647 (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Burlington, ON, Canada) as previously described (20).
The biological half-life of HPG-Gd (with no fluorescent tag) in mice has previously been examined in biodistribution studies and was reported as 32.6 h (20).
HPG-GdF was administered as a 6 $\mu$L/g bolus dose from 100 mg/mL (0.2 mM) using an intravenous (i.v.) catheter; therefore, the administered molar dose of HPG was 1.2 nmol/g and that of the chelated Gd(III) was 240-360 nmol/g (determined according to an estimated 200-300 chelates per HPG molecule (20)).
Assuming a blood volume of 5\% of mouse body weight, peak blood concentration of HPG-GdF is 24$\mu$M.
This value has been used to normalize relative tissue concentrations (Fig.~\ref{hpgpaper1:fig2}(B)) and to calculate the fractional plasma volume (fPV; see Section 2.4).
The relaxivity of HPG-GdF has previously been measured and reported to be 1075 mM$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$1, which is approximately 300 times greater than that of Gadovist (3.58 mM$^{-1}$1 s$^{-1}$1) (20).
Gadovist (Bayer Healthcare, Toronto, ON, Canada; 607.4 Da) was administered by i.v. catheter as a 5 $\mu$L/g bolus dose from 60 mM solution, for an administered molar dose of Gadovist of 300 nmol/g.
All in-scanner i.v. injections were performed using a power injector at a rate of 1 mL/min.
An extended fluid line connected to the i.v. catheter secured to the tail vein of the mice permitted remote initiation of injections outside the scanner room.
Injections included a small volume (<40 $\mu$L) of heparinized saline followed by the contrast agent, which was then followed by a 20 $\mu$L flush of heparinized saline.

\subsection{MRI acquisition}

All MRI experiments were performed at the UBC MRI Research Centre on a 7T Bruker BioSpec 70/30 scanner at room temperature with a combination of volume (transmit)/surface (receive) coil.
Each imaging session began with axial RARE T$_2$-weighted images for morphological reference and precise alignment of imaging plane.
Further T$_1$-weighted RARE images were acquired for qualitative assessment of contrast agent distribution.
During the first scanning session, T$_1$ and flip angle maps were acquired prior to a DCE-MRI experiment, followed by another T$_1$ measurement.
At each imaging session slice location and orientation were adjusted to match previous sessions.
T$_1$ measurements and flip angle mapping were performed using a multi-slice FLASH variable flip angle experiment (FLASH TR/TE = 500/2.75, FA = 10$^{\circ}$, 20$^{\circ}$, 30$^{\circ}$, 40$^{\circ}$, 50$^{\circ}$, 60$^{\circ}$, 70$^{\circ}$, 80$^{\circ}$, 90$^{\circ}$, 100$^{\circ}$, 110$^{\circ}$, 120$^{\circ}$, 130$^{\circ}$, 140$^{\circ}$, 150$^{\circ}$, 160$^{\circ}$, 170$^{\circ}$, 180$^{\circ}$, 190$^{\circ}$, 200$^{\circ}$, 215$^{\circ}$) and data were fit simultaneously for T$_1$ and the B1 scaling factor map.
DCE-MRI data was collected at 2.24 s time resolution (FLASH; TR/TE = 35/2.75; FA = 40; NR = 1200).
T$_1$ and DCE-MRI experiments all had identical geometry (matrix = 128 x 64; three slices; voxel size = 0.33 mm x 0.297 mm x 1.5 mm; 2.5 mm slice separation).
A follow-up T$_1$ measurement was performed (FLASH; TR/TE = 35/2.75; FA = 10$^{\circ}$, 20$^{\circ}$, 30$^{\circ}$, 40$^{\circ}$, 50$^{\circ}$, 60$^{\circ}$, 80$^{\circ}$, 100$^{\circ}$, 120$^{\circ}$) and the B$_1$ scaling factor map from the baseline acquisition was used to determine post-contrast T$_1$ (assuming that B$_1$ scaling does not change due to contrast injection).
Difference maps of relaxation rates $\delta$R$_1$ = 1/T$_1$(post-contrast) - 1/T$_1$(precontrast) were constructed for a measure of contrast agent concentration.
Animals received two DCE-MRI scans 24-48h apart, with Gadovist administered and scanned at the first session and HPG-GdF administered and scanned at the subsequent session with tumors collected for histological processing at about 60 min post administration of their HPG-GdF.

\subsection{MRI data analysis}

Regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn on T2-weighted RARE images to outline the tumor using ImageJ (NIH), and all other MR analysis was performed using MATLAB (MathWorks, R2009a) and Python.
T$_1$ and flip-angle maps were calculated from variable flip-angle data with a slice-profile correction based on simulations described by Parker et al.~\cite{Parker:2001wj}.
The same method was extended to provide time-dependent T$_1$ and concentration-time in DCE data series.
Areas under the curves (AUCs) were numerically integrated starting from the bolus arrival time, or, for tumor-averaged AUC, starting from the common injection time point and extended to the indicated time points (1 and 37 min).
Bolus arrival time (BAT) is the time when detectable signal enhancement begins for a voxel (Fig.~\ref{hpgpaper1:fig2}(A)) due to contrast agent arrival.
Based on the control-chart decision criterion and the Western Electric decision rules from MATLABâ€™s statistical toolbox~\cite{Shewhart:1931tq}, voxel enhancement was detected as a positive change from baseline signal for three consecutive timepoints (frames) (i) in the same direction, (ii) starting 5 s before the time of injection or later and (iii) for at least 10\% of all timepoints following initial change of signal away from baseline.
Therefore, voxels with a finite BAT and for which at least 10\% of the following intensities were classified as enhancing by the BAT criteria were called enhancing voxels, whereas all other voxels were labeled as non-enhancing.

A change from baseline was determined to have occurred
when any one of the following inclusion criteria were met:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item any point fell outside of 3 SDs from the average baseline concentration, or
	\item two of three consecutive points fell outside of the 2 SD limit on the same side of the mean, or
	\item four of five consecutive points fell outside of the 1 SD line, on the same side of the centre line, or
	\item eight consecutive points all fell on one side of the centre line.
\end{enumerate}

In the illustrated example (Fig.~\ref{hpgpaper1:fig2}(A)), a change from the mean was identified at Frame 31 and the two following scans by Rule (1); therefore, the BAT point was selected as Frame 30.
The centre line (mean of baseline) and upper and lower control limits ($\pm$3 SDs) are drawn for reference.

\subsubsection{Pharmacokinetic modeling of DCE-MRI data}

\textit{Gadovist.} The extended Tofts model was used and three parameters resulted: K${trans}$, vE, and vP~\cite{Sourbron:2011ce}.
The arterial input function (AIF) for this model was determined previously by our laboratory using a projection-based method~\cite{Moroz:2013ee}.
\textit{HPG-GdF.} A two-parameter linear model was applied~\cite{Pathak:2005gu}.
Two parameters were used to characterize the MCA time curves: (1) the rapid increase at the time of injection (related to the fPV) and (2) the slope of the later enhancement (aPS) (Fig.~\ref{hpgpaper1:fig2}(B)).
The relative plasma volume could be determined from the ratio of concentrations in the voxel of interest to the concentration in whole blood in the seconds after injection, since extra-vascular spread of the agent was negligible at this time.
The slope of the concentration time curve following contrast arrival is proportional to the permeability-surface area product (PS) when the assumption of a permeability-limited environment is valid.
However, in the highly variable tumor microenvironment, extravasation of contrast agent may deplete the intra-vascular concentration appreciably in conditions of high permeability, which would increase the relative contribution of perfusion to the composite measure of PS.
To stress that the interpretation of this slope value depends on the assumption of a permeability-limited environment, we term the slope the apparent permeability-surface area product (aPS)~\cite{DaldrupLink:2004gy,Dafni:2002kb}.

\subsection{Histology}

Cryosections of 10 $\mu$m were obtained along the plane perpendicular to the fiducial marker at depths corresponding to MR imaged slices.
Sections were imaged for DiOC7(3) and HPGGdF native fluorescence and fixed in acetone-methanol for 10min prior to staining and re-imaging for CD31 (PECAM/ CD31) and Hoechst 3342, labeling vascular endothelium and cell nuclei, respectively.
Sections were imaged as previously described~\cite{Kyle:2007ch} using a system of tiling adjacent microscope fields of view such that images of entire tumor cryosections were captured at a resolution of 1.5 $\mu$m/pixel.
Using both fiducial and anatomical landmarks, histological sections were chosen to match the MR slices.
Using ImageJ~\cite{Collins:2007jr} and user-supplied algorithms, digital images were superimposed and manually cropped to tumor tissue boundaries; staining artifacts and necrosis were also removed for some analyses.
Positive fluorescence for CD31 and DiOC7(3) images was obtained by applying a threshold, with neighboring positive pixels grouped as ``objects''. 
The average distance of tissue to the nearest vascular object was reported as a repeatable measure of vascular density.
Perfused vessel fraction (PF) was calculated as the proportion of CD31-positive objects that had at least 20\% overlap with positive DiOC7(3) or HPG-GdF pixels on the overlaid image.
Data for individual tumors were displayed as mean $\pm$ SEM values.
HPG-GdF extravasation was assessed by its distance from blood vessels: pixels from the HPG-GdF fluorescence image were sorted according to their distance from vascular objects and the average HPG-GdF fluorescence intensity was reported.

(C) Whole tumor maps of HPG-GdF (red) in relation to vasculature (blue) show that at early (2 min) timepoints HPG-GdF is primarily overlapped with vasculature, but by 60 min there is substantial heterogeneity, where some vessels have greater amounts of perivascular HPG-GdF than others. HPG-GdF accumulates over several days but does so heterogeneously, and does not distribute through tumor tissue even after prolonged exposures.}

\section{Results}

\subsection{HPG-GdF accumulates in tumor tissue in the extravascular space but does not distribute far from vasculature}

Averaged data from whole HT29 tumor xenograft images obtained using MRI and histology showed accumulation of HPG-GdF over time (Fig.~\ref{hpgpaper1:fig3}(A)), as previously described~\cite{Saatchi:2012hc}.
HPG-GdF fluorescence was detectable within or very near to CD31-labeled tumor vessels as early as 2 min following contrast agent injection (Fig.~\ref{hpgpaper1:fig3}(B), (C)).
More HPGGdF fluorescence accumulated in histological tumor sections over time, but very little agent was observed at distances farther than 40 $\mu$m from the vasculature, even at 7 and 15 days (Fig.~\ref{hpgpaper1:fig3}(B), (C)).
By 60min there was extravascular accumulation of HPG-GdF around some vessels, but considerable inter-vessel heterogeneity was observed.
Some vessels showed no HPG-GdF fluorescence (Fig.~\ref{hpgpaper1:fig3}(C)).

\subsection{Bolus arrival time (BAT) for HPG-GdF as a screen for viable tissue}

Maps of BAT overlaid on T$_1$-RARE images for both Gadovist and HPG-GdF are shown in Fig.~\ref{hpgpaper1:fig4}, Rows 1 and 2.
A pattern of faster contrast enhancement at the tumor margins was consistent for both contrast agents.
While Gadovist eventually distributes to all the tissue, many voxels fail to enhance with HPG-GdF within the 37 min imaging period.
Comparison of HPG-GdF BAT-enhancing voxels with a histological image delineating viable versus necrotic tissue (Fig.~\ref{hpgpaper1:fig4}, Rows 2 and 3) shows that the non-enhancing voxels consistently corresponded to large areas of tumor necrosis.
A negative association was seen between the necrosis fraction determined by histology and the fraction of enhancing voxels for HPG-GdF (Fig.~\ref{hpgpaper1:fig2}(C)).
For subsequent analysis of vascular function, only voxels enhancing with HPG-GdF using the BAT criteria were evaluated.

Good slice matching between imaging sessions is achieved using implanted fiducial marker tubes, an example of which is shown for tumor T01, Row 1, where the arrow points to the dark region where the tube is resting between the tumor and the back of the animal.}

 \end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Fractional plasma volume (fPV) and apparent permeability-surface area product (aPS) as measures of vascular function}

HPG-GdF-enhancing voxels were further characterized for their plasma volume (fPV) by calculating the magnitude of the rapid signal increase after injection and for their extravascular accumulation (aPS) by measuring the slope of the enhancement curve after the initial increase for the duration of the DCE scan (0-2000 s).
The patterns of high and low fPV and aPS were often similar to each other, though there are notable differences.
A linear regression analysis comparing fPV with aPS for whole-slice averages yields an R$^2$ of 0.11, suggesting they are independent of each other.
As a detailed example, tumor HT01 has a region of high aPS and low fPV (Fig.~\ref{hpgpaper1:fig5}(A)), as well as a region exhibiting the opposite, with high fPV and low aPS (Fig.~\ref{hpgpaper1:fig5}(B)).
The corresponding histological section seemed to validate these observations, where the region with high fPV has a greater density of CD31-stained vessels and the region with greater aPS has more HPG-GdF in the extravascular compartment.
While histological data enables a detailed view of HPG-GdF accumulation, the actual rate of extravasation may only be determined by the dynamic MR data, as illustrated by the schematic enhancement curve (Fig.~\ref{hpgpaper1:fig5}(C)).
The corresponding K${trans}$ map derived from Gadovist concentrations shows high values in both the high aPS and high fPV regions of this tumor (Fig.~\ref{hpgpaper1:fig4}, Column 1).
Therefore, both fPV and aPS played important roles contributing to overall tumor vascular function, had measurable intra-tumor heterogeneity and produced data that was distinct from and more informative than DCE-MRI derived parameters for Gadovist.

 A region with high aPS values that does not correspond to high fPV is magnified (A) and compared with a region having high fPV that does not correspond to high aPS (B). 
 The high fPV region has notably greater vascular density, and HPG-GdF is clearly seen overlapping with vessels (black) or accumulating in the extravascular space. 
 The high aPS region also has HPG-GdF in the extravascular space. 
 The dynamic MR-derived parameters are better able to illustrate the functional features of tumor vasculature than are the static histological data, which only reflects the environment at a single, terminal endpoint (C).}

\subsection{Variable vascular function in HCT116 and HT29 human colorectal xenografts}

HPG-GdF accumulated to a greater degree in HT29 colorectal xenografts relative to HCT116, and this was seen at all distances from vessels (Fig.~\ref{hpgpaper1:fig6}(A)).
HCT116 and HT29 colorectal xenografts grow at similar rates in mouse models but exhibit distinct vascular function parameters (data summarized in Table 1).
Overall, HT29 tumors possessed a greater density of vessels (CD31 average distance was 82.3 $\pm$ 3.0 $\mu$m for HCT116 and 40.5 $\pm$ 1.5 $\mu$m for HT29, p < 0.05*).
However many vessels were unlabeled for the fluorescent dye (carbocyanine) used as a histological perfusion marker; the density of perfused vessels was similar between the two xenograft models (CD31 vessels labeled for carbocyanine, PF, was 47.8$\pm$5.4\% for HCT116 and 36.0$\pm$2.1\% for HT29, p > 0.05).
The density of vessels labeled for HPG-GdF fluorescence was much greater in HT29 tumors (HPG-GdF+ve CD31, average distance was 172$\pm$10$\mu$m for HCT116 and 88.9 $\pm$6.3$\mu$m; p<0.05*).
In addition to a greater density of HPGGdF-positive vessels, the high MW contrast agent was able to accumulate to a greater degree in the extravascular space around vessels in HT29 cells.
This effect can be seen in the histological images of the compared tumor models collected 60min post HPG-GdF administration (Fig.~\ref{hpgpaper1:fig6}(B)).

\subsection{MRI analysis of HPG-GdF in HCT116 and HT29 xenografts: BAT, fPV and aPS}

Administration of neither Gadovist nor HPG-GdF was useful in detecting the difference in vascular function between HCT116 and HT29 tumors using the initial area under the gadolinium concentration curve (AUGC), as the slice-averaged means were not significantly different between tumor groups (AUGC for Gadovist in HCT116 was 5.09 $\pm$ 0.83 mM s and that in HT29 was 7.68 $\pm$ 1.66 mM s, p > 0.05; that for HPG-GdF in HCT116 was 6.41 $\pm$1.71x10$^{-1}$3 mMs and that in HT29 was 9.62$\pm$1.64x10$^{-1}$3 mMs, p > 0.05) (data summarized in Tables 2 and 3).
Similarity between models was also observed qualitatively in the parameter maps with AUGC or K${trans}$ overlaid on T$_1$-RARE images shown in Figs.
4 and 7.
Both tumor models show higher AUGC values in the tumor margins for both contrast agents.

 A greater degree of HPG-GdF accumulation can easily be appreciated in the HT29 tumors.}

However, an MR-measured difference between HCT116 and HT29 vascular function was seen with the BAT data for HPGGdF, as the fraction of enhancing voxels was significantly lower in the HCT116 relative to the HT29 tumors (BAT-EV for HPGGdF in HCT116 was 52.2 $\pm$ 4.8\% and that in HT29 was 81.8 $\pm$ 5.0\%, p < 0.05*) (Table 3).
This corresponded to the histological data, which also shows HCT116 tumors as having a greater proportion of necrotic tissue (necrosis fraction for HCT116 was 52.4$\pm$3.6\% versus 37.7$\pm$5.1\% in HT29, p<0.05*).
Of the HPGGdF BAT-enhancing voxels, the averaged fPV and aPS parameters were also determined (Table 3), and no difference was seen with the plasma volume between tumor models (fractional fPV for HCT116 is 2.67 $\pm$ 0.33 x 10$^{-1}$4 and that for HT29 is 2.16 $\pm$ 0.27 x 10$^{-1}$4, p > 0.05), but a trend of greater aPS was seen in the HT29 xenografts (aPS for HCT116 was 2.38 $\pm$ 1.00 x 10$^{-1}$8 and that for HT29 was 5.81 $\pm$ 1.4 x 10$^{-1}$8, p = 0.056*).
aPS of HPGGdF was the only MR-derived biomarker able to detect the significant difference in vascular function between these two tumor models.
Complete data sets for HCT116 tumors are shown in Fig.~\ref{hpgpaper1:fig7}.

\section{Discussion}

The use of MCAs for imaging and describing tumor vascular function is a widely pursued area of research.
Many studies have investigated a range of sizes, where smaller molecules extravasate and distribute through tissue too quickly to be considered as sensitive blood pool agents, and larger molecules often accumulate too slowly for adequate signal detection~\cite{Kyle:2007ch,Tang:2013fi,Sourbron:2011ce}.
In this work we describe HPG-GdF as an MR-visible MCA of 583 kDa, for which we have derived useful biomarkers that have sensitivity in measuring vascular function.
While the signal-to-noise from HPG-GdF concentration-time curves is not adequate to fit a complex pharmacokinetic model to determine parameters such as v$_p$, v$_e$ and K${trans}$, enhancement was measurable in most tumor voxels.
The number of Gd chelates on the HPG-GdF is approximately 300 per carrier molecule, which is high relative to many albumin chelates, the most common MCA in preclinical use, which typically have about 20 chelates per carrier~\cite{Ogan:1987tg}.
In addition to a greater number of Gd per carrier, the HPG-GdF accumulates in the perivascular space and fails to distribute more than a few micrometers from most vessels within a short DCE imaging timeframe (Fig.~\ref{hpgpaper1:fig3}).
This accumulation could provide a greater concentration for detection of a local, permeable tumor vessel and avoids the risk of conflating this with the distribution and accumulation elsewhere in tumors.
These attributes of HPGGdFmay make it more sensitive and more specific than a smaller MCA such as albumin-Gd-DTPA.
A minimum DCE imaging time from the presented data would appear to be about 15 min for the analyses described, which is longer than the suggested 5min ideal for practical clinical utility~\cite{Turetschek:2004bw}.
It is possible that greater signal could also be obtained by decreasing the time resolution from the 2.4s used in these studies, since HPG-GdF remains largely intravascular.
HPG-GdF contains the Gd-DOTA complex, which is highly thermodynamically stable and kinetically inert.
The dissociation constant for Gd-DOTA (log K = 24.7) is much higher than those for CaDOTA (log K = 17.23) or Mg-DOTA (log K = 11.92), hence neither Ca nor Mg can transmetallate Gd from the Gd-DOTA complex~\cite{Baranyai:2005ta}.
Biodegradation of HPG-GdF is therefore likely minimal, occurring through enzymatic attack of the end group, similar to that seen for polyethylene glycol~\cite{Kawai:2002fc}.
However, the long half-life and relatively slow excretion of HPGs through the reticuloendothelial system of the liver suggest that the potential for toxicity should be investigated and monitored.
A biodegradable version of HPG has recently been synthesized and might circumvent these potential concerns, and will be a focus in future DCE studies investigating the use of HPGs as MR-visible MCAs~\cite{Shenoi:2013id}.
Limited extravasation of HPG-GdF is likely due to the selective permeability of tumor vessels with adequate pore sizes for passage of the bulky molecule, a phenomenon described as the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect~\cite{Maeda:2013hq}.
Limited distribution through the interstitium is also most probably the result of its significant size.
We have observed HPG-GdF to be much more restricted in its distribution than is suggested by the diffusion coefficients (D(HPG) = 3.7 x 10$^{-1}$7 cm$^2$ s$^{-1}$1 and D(Gadovist) = 3.6 x 10$^{-1}$6 cm$^2$ s$^{-1}$1), as the larger agent reaches only 10-15$\mu$m away from vessels within an hour whereas Gadovist reaches all areas of a tumor.
HPG-GdF molecules experience greater obstacles to their movement through the heterogeneous tumor microenvironment due to their size, but also possibly due to steric hindrances, non-specific binding or sequestration~\cite{Minchinton:2006gs}.
The large size of HPG-GdF is a significant advantage.
An approximately exponential increase in sensitivity for detection of permeability has been reported with increasing MCA size (19).
If extravasation of HPG-GdF only occurs in vessels that are permeable, and the agent does not distribute through the extravascular space to distances away from vessels, then MR-visible HPG-GdF enhancement suggests the presence of vasculature, and accumulation of the agent over time indicates the local presence of a hyperpermeable vessel.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

 \caption{Vascular function in HCT116 xenografts. Whole-slice maps are presented for individual HCT116 tumors (T01-T05, vertical columns) for parameters derived from MR imaging of Gadovist (BAT, AUGC60, K$^{trans}$), MR imaging of HPG-GdF (BAT, fPv, aPS, AUGC60) and histological imaging (necrosis).}
 \label{hpgpaper1:fig7}  
 \end{center}
\end{figure}

A typical enhancement curve for HPG-GdF is shown in Fig.~\ref{hpgpaper1:fig2}.
The size of the initial step-like enhancement is interpreted as the fPV, and the slope of signal change for the remaining enhancement is reported as the aPS, reflecting the extravascular accumulation of HPG-GdF (Fig.~\ref{hpgpaper1:fig2}).
These parameters are not correlated with each other, with either value potentially significantly higher or lower than the other in the same voxels (Fig.~\ref{hpgpaper1:fig5}).
A pattern of faster enhancement at the tumor margins is consistent for both contrast agents, and, while Gadovist eventually arrives in all the tissue, including regions of necrosis, many voxels that correspond to necrotic regions fail to enhance with HPG-GdF within the 37 min imaging session.
We found that HPG-GdF BAT-enhancing voxels correspond to areas without necrosis: see Figs.~\ref{hpgpaper1:fig4} and ~\ref{hpgpaper1:fig7} for parameter maps of all BAT-enhancing voxels compared with histologically validated necrotic regions.
Therefore, we identified perfused regions of tumor tissue for further vascular function analysis using the straightforward approach of selecting voxels that had positive BATs for their HPG-GdF enhancement curves.
Selection of viable tissue and the exclusion of necrotic tissue is a desirable approach for controlling for inter-tumor heterogeneity, since MRI data is most often described as a whole-tumor average.
In the event that different tumors possess variable necrotic burdens, or if the necrotic fraction increases over time with treatment, selective analysis of viable tissue can control for this variability.
Qualitative comparisons of well-matched, whole-slice images from multiple modalities emphasize the utility of screening for BAT-enhancing voxels to select for perfused and viable tissues.

Without this information analysis may be restricted to regions of tissues at the tumor margins where hot spots of vascularization are observed histologically, and tissue is assumed to be viable in the MR image~\cite{Pathak:2005gu,Li:2005gw}.
In the colorectal xenografts examined here the amount of necrosis varied considerably, and, while it is typically located more in the core than the tumor margins, there is substantial inter-tumor heterogeneity with respect to the amount and location of necrosis.
Notably, while the values for K${trans}$(Gadovist) are on average higher around the entire tumor rim, the fPV and aPS values are more heterogeneously arranged around the rim and within the interior of the tumor.
Our more comprehensive approach, validated by observations of viable tissue and perfused vessels within tumor interiors in histological sections, is a significant improvement over selectively assessing limited regions or hotpots for histological or MR quantitative analysis.
Traditional DCE-derived parameters such as AUC and K${trans}$ are composite measures influenced to varying degrees by vascular surface area, permeability and blood flow.
Our histological data supports a significant range in the propensity for HPG-GdF to extravasate, suggesting that assumptions of perfusion or permeability-limited conditions are not applicable to all areas of the tumor microenvironment.
Hence, we cannot conclude that aPS is exclusively proportional to permeability-surface area (PS) in the whole microenvironment.
For example, although the amount of HPG-GdF leaking into the extravascular space is dependent on the vessel being permeable to large molecules, the amount of accumulation, and therefore the amount of signal enhancement, may still be impacted by the concentration of contrast agent within the vessel.
Longitudinal gradients can occur locally in permeable vessels as the contrast agent leaks out, despite plasma concentrations remaining consistent in overall systemic circulation~\cite{Erickson:2003wt,Dewhirst:1999jh}.
Thus, the aPS is a measure of vascular function that has contributions from permeability as well as, when permeability is very high, perfusion.
These limitations in the physiological interpretation of aPS are similar to those that apply to K${trans}$ and AUC for all contrast-enhanced modeling.
Parameters that are based on the amount and proportion of contrast agent enhancement are dependent on fewer assumptions than are pharmacokinetic model-derived parameters such as K${trans}$.
Biophysical signals are dependent on the many variables necessarily involved in obtaining MR images, such as the scanner, imaging sequence, RF coil and analysis techniques.
Interpreting magnitudes of change in highly variable tumors may be more reliable than assuming invariable pharmacokinetic attributes or unchanging tumor microenvironments, and may make simplified biomarkers such as fPV and aPS more applicable to clinical studies conducted across multiple centers~\cite{OConnor:2012ie}

\section{Conclusion}

HPG-GdF is a largely intravascular MCA that selectively extravasates from hyperpermeable tumor vessels, accumulating in the perivascular regions without distributing through the tumor interstitium.
The high concentration of Gd chelates per carrier molecule in combination with its excellent solubility makes HPG-GdF detection possible despite the relatively low plasma fraction within tumors.
By carefully comparing the vessel parameters of small and large molecule contrast agents in the same tumor, as well as comprehensively assessing the location of MCA within the tumor relative to vasculature and necrosis, we conclude that BAT, fPV and aPS biomarkers derived from HPG-GdF enhancement provide a sensitive and specific approach to measuring tumor vascular function.
HPG-GdF and these analysis techniques would be appropriate in the evaluation of tumor angiogenesis and response to treatment for preclinical research, with potential for eventual translation to the clinic.

\chapter{Heterogeneous distribution of trastuzumab in HER2-positive xenografts and metastases: role of the tumour microenvironment}
\label{ch:HPG2}

\section{Background}

Treatment options for patients with the aggressive HER2-positive form of breast cancer continue to improve, though metastatic breast cancer remains a largely incurable disease.
Brain metastases are of particular importance in HER2-positive breast cancer patients, as with improved treatments and prolonged survival the incidence of brain metastases as the first evidence of relapse has increased [1, 2].
This effect has been attributed to the phenomenon of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) creating a sanctuary site by preventing drug access [3, 4].
Antibody-based therapeutics such as trastuzumab are proposed to have difficulty crossing the BBB and therefore brain metastases evade drug activity [1, 5, 6].
In addition to the BBB, specific characteristics of the tumor microenvironment, beginning with a relative paucity of functional vessels, can thwart the access of drugs to their targets such that a population of under-exposed cells may survive and repopulate the tumor [7].
We have demonstrated that many small molecule cytotoxics have limited tumor tissue penetration in both in vivo and in vivo model systems due to difficulties with drug supply, flux through tissue, consumption or sequestration by cancer cells close to blood vessels [8, 9, 10, 11, 12].

Macromolecular compounds such as monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) face particular extravascular distribution difficulties due to their high molecular weights and target-binding affinity [13, 14].
The relatively slow distribution of MAbs has been attributed to the binding site barrier hypothesis (BSBH), where in the case of high affinity binding of the MAb to antigen, MAb distribution is limited by its binding in the presence of ample antigen [15].
Data from our lab in the vector overexpressed MDA-435-LCC6HER2 model showed that despite the ability of trastuzumab to distribute far from vessels in tumors with relatively even HER2 distribution, there persisted HER2-positive tissue with poor access to trastuzumab after peak plasma exposures [16].
Heterogeneity is very striking at the vessel level, as trastuzumab is able to extravasate from only a subpopulation of perfused vessels.
Other groups have also demonstrated a limitation on the accumulation of trastuzumab in tumors, focusing on net tumor accumulation [13, 14, 17].

The ability of a drug to access and affect all its target cells is intuitively crucial for treatment success.
The relatively slow distribution of MAbs through the interstitium in solid tumors is recognized, but the long half-life of MAbs and prolonged plasma exposure is expected to ensure adequate time to access all the tissues in most treatment scenarios.
However, we have found that in addition to distributing slowly, MAbs experience additional barriers, leaving some areas of tissue with inadequate drug exposure.
The aim for this study was to use HER2-positive tumor and metastases models of cancer to determine potential limits to trastuzumab access that may represent a mechanism of resistance to targeted therapies.
The microenvironments of HER2-positive tumors and metastases are examined in detail using immunohistochemistry maps, 3D tissue models and dynamic imaging of tumor vasculature.

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Reagents}

Trastuzumab and bevacizumab (Roche, Genentech) were provided by the British Columbia Cancer Agency pharmacy; dilutions to 1-2 mg/ml were prepared in sterile 0.9\% NaCl before intra-peritoneal (i.p.) injection.
Human isotype control IgG1 (Sigma) was administered from similar concentrations.
Trastuzumab and IgG antibodies for use in combination with bevacizumab were tagged with fluorescent labels according to Alexa Fluor 546 Protein Labeling Kit (ThermoFisher) instructions.
Hypoxia marker pimonidazole (Hypoxyprobe) was administered at 60 mg/kg as an i.p.
injection 2 h prior to tissue harvest.
Fluorescent dye DiOC7(3) (Molecular Probes), 0.6 mg/ml dissolved in 75\% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide/25\% sterile H2O, was administered intravenously as a marker of vessel perfusion 5 min prior to tissue harvest [18].

\subsection{Mice and tumors}

Female NOD-SCID mice weighing 20-28 g between 8 and 16 weeks of age were bred and maintained in our institutional pathogen free animal facility.
Mice were implanted with 60 day 17-$\beta$-estradiol pellets (Innovative Research of America) subcutaneously 3 days before implantation of BT474 or MDA-MB-361 tumors.
Tumors were implanted as single cell suspensions (2-10ï¿½10$^6$ cells) into the subcutaneous sacral region or into the inguinal mammary fat pads.
Metastases models were implanted as single cell suspensions (2-5ï¿½10$^5$ cells per implant) as i.v. or i.p. injections for SKOV3 or BT474 models, or as intra-cardiac (i.c.) injection for MDA-MDA-MB-231-BR-HER2 models, with animals euthanized a maximum of 23 days after implant.

\subsection{MRI}
MRI experiments were performed at the UBC MRI Research Centre on a 7T Bruker Biospec 70/30 scanner at room temperature with a combination volume (transmit)/surface (receive) coil.
DCE-MR imaging data was collected as previously described [19].
Gadovist (Bayer Healthcare) was administered by i.v. catheter as a 5 $\mu$L/g bolus dose from 60 mM solution.
Macromolecular contrast agent hyperbranched polyglycerol (HPG-GdF, 500 kDa) was synthesized as previously described [20, 21] and administered as a 6 $\mu$L/g bolus dose from 100 mg/mL (0.2 mM).
Regions of interest (ROI) were drawn on T2-weighted RARE images to outline the tumor using ImageJ (NIH) and all other MR analysis was performed using Python.
Area Under the Curves (AUC) for Gadovist was determined from the common injection time point to 60 s.
A two-parameter linear model was applied to characterize HPG-GdF signal-intensity curves for fractional plasma volume (fPV) determined by the rapid increase at time of injection and for apparent permeability surface area product (aPS) calculated as the slope of later enhancement, as previously described [19].
Both MR and histological modalities imaged slices in the plane perpendicular to an implanted fiducial marker tube to minimize angular differences between MR and histological image slices [22].

\subsection{Immunohistochemistry}
The general immunohistochemical procedure used has been previously reported [16].
Briefly, 10 $\mu$m tumor cryosections were air-dried, imaged for native DiOC7(3) or Alexa 546-tagged trastuzumab fluorescence, and fixed in 50\% (v/v) acetone/methanol for 10 min at room temperature.
Trastuzumab and IgG were visualized in sections using Alexa 546 goat anti-human secondary antibody (Invitrogen).
HER2 was subsequently stained with 2.2ï¿½10$^{-3}$ mg/mL trastuzumab as a primary detection antibody and goat anti-human Alexa 546 secondary.
Additional staining was performed using antibodies to PECAM/CD31 (BD PharMingen), pimonidazole (hypoxprobe) collagen IV (Gene Tex) and $\alpha$SMA (Abcam).
Visualization of primary detection antibodies was done using Alexa fluorescence secondary antibodies of appropriate species using 488 nm, 647 nm and 750 nm wavelengths.
Nuclear density was stained using Hoechst 33342 (Thermofisher) and imaged at 380 nm.

\subsection{Image acquisition and analysis}
Sections were imaged as previously described [9] using a system of tiling adjacent microscope fields of view at a resolution of 0.75 $\mu$m/pixel.
Using ImageJ [23] and user-supplied algorithms, images were superimposed and manually cropped to tumor tissue boundaries with staining artifacts and necrosis removed.
False color images were constructed in ImageJ by converting greyscale images to color and overlaying selected layers: trastuzumab (magenta), HER2 (blue or grey), Hoechst 33342 (grey), CD31 (blue), carbocyanine (cyan), pimonidazole (green) and $\alpha$SMA or CIV (red).
Positive fluorescent staining is reported as average intensity (range 1-255) for pimonidazole, trastuzumab and HER2.
Perfused vascular density was determined by applying a threshold to CD31 and DiOC7(3) images, with neighboring positive pixels grouped as ``objects''; CD31 objects with a minimum 20\% overlap with DiOC7(3) objects were determined to be perfused vessels.
All image pixels were sorted based on their nearest perfused vessel and the average distance is reported as a repeatable measure of vascular density.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Measures of vascular density, architecture and function do not consistently correlate with heterogeneous patterns of trastuzumab distribution}

Significant inter-vessel heterogeneity in trastuzumab distribution is seen in orthotopic BT474 xenografts, with neighboring patent vessels often showing variable amounts of trastuzumab bound to perivascular cells (Fig.
4a), similar to previous findings in MDA-435-LCC6 vector-overexpressing HER2-positive tumors [16].
Non-patent vessels (red arrows) never have extravascular trastuzumab, suggesting intermittent perfusion is not a significant mechanism for reduced trastuzumab access.
The same inter-vessel heterogeneity is seen in MDA-MB-361 tumors where vascular function dynamics were further characterized by imaging MR contrast agent Gadovist accumulation (Fig.
4b).
Matched histology slices were stained for the location of trastuzumab, vascular patency and markers of vascular maturity CIV and $\alpha$SMA.
Some regions are high for MR-imaged Gadovist uptake, reflecting high vascular function, but these do not consistently co-register with regions of high trastuzumab distribution in histology sections.
A quantitative correlation between Gadovist AUC and trastuzumab in matched image slices obtained from multiple tumors was not evident.
Similarly, neither $\alpha$SMA nor CIV are present to a greater degree proximal to vessels with or without trastuzumab bound to perivascular cells.

   \label{hpgpaper2:fig4}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Dynamic vascular permeability and blood volume measurements do not consistently relate to patterns of trastuzumab distribution}

The histological measure of perfusion using carbocyanine is a useful indication of vessel patency, however it is static and therefore its interpretation is limited.
The role of vascular function on trastuzumab distribution was further investigated using dynamic contrast enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) of a high molecular weight contrast agent, HPG-GdF (MW 500 kDa) (Fig.
6).
As previously described, repeat imaging of contrast agent presence in the tumors is analysed and the initial appearance of HPG-GdF reflects fPV and its accumulation over time indicates the apparent permeability surface area (aPS) [19].
Tumors were excised immediately after imaging; corresponding histological sections are compared to the DCE-MRI derived parameter maps.
BT474 tumors have microregionally variable levels of both fPV and aPS, each exhibiting regions of distinction.
Regions of high fPV are well matched by histological images of carbocyanine that indicate areas of very high perfusion but some of these regions do not have any significant accumulation of trastuzumab.
The reverse can also be found, where regions with relatively low fPV correspond to high trastuzumab.
Similarly, there are some significant trastuzumab accumulation areas that have relatively low aPS while some high aPS values correspond to areas with relatively low trastuzumab.
Examples of good or bad correlation between vascular function and trastuzumab distribution are highlighted with arrows and suggest that neither of the MRI-derived parameters consistently or adequately explain microregional distribution of trastuzumab.

\section{Discussion}

This study has shown direct evidence of poor trastuzumab access to metastases of the brain in a preclinical model.
Small clusters of cells that are immediately surrounded by highly perfused brain, liver or lung tissues may remain incompletely or in some cases totally unbound for trastuzumab.
Some avascular metastases of the brain may be outside the BBB and therefore have poor access to trastuzumab, while larger lesions with active angiogenesis and blood vessel support may have a blood-tumor barrier (BTB) with greater trastuzumab delivery, however we have shown that microregional distribution of trastuzumab can remain highly heterogeneous and incomplete even when delivered by vessels within HER2-positive lesions.
Our data are in agreement with other studies evaluating the permeability of brain metastases, which have found no correlation between metastases size, vessel density, aggressiveness or morphology and their permeability [5, 24].
Mittapalli et al. have used mathematical modeling and MRI data to show a limit in the vascular pore size of MDA-MB-231-BR-HER2 metastases that would preclude access to MAbs including trastuzumab [25].
Other groups have also shown poor trastuzumab access in this model [26, 27].
As found here, trastuzumab has been detected in larger brain lesions in murine models [28] where higher systemic doses of the MAb were required to achieve anti-cancer efficacy seen for tumors grown in the mammary fat pad.
Accumulation over time has also been noted in patient metastases including those of the brain, where labeled antibodies were used for diagnostic purposes using PET [29, 30].
It is unknown if human tumors or metastases exhibit the same barriers to MAb access.
As we have shown, access of trastuzumab to metastases and the distribution within can be highly heterogeneous, and is likely to be highly model and patient specific.
Ultimately, a majority of patients treated with trastuzumab eventually experience progression and relapse.
The rate of brain metastases has increased for HER2-positive patients following treatment with trastuzumab, suggesting the MAb therapeutic is less effective for tumors `behind' the BBB than in metastases elsewhere such as the liver and lung [6].
Here we show direct evidence of poor trastuzumab access to HER2-positive brain metastases and suggest that this confirms non-uniform access of MAbs to cancers and metastases may be driving a significant portion of resistance to their effects.

Using tumor mapping analysis and DCE-MRI we further examined the impacts of HER2 expression, tumor blood vessel architecture, vascular function and the tumor microenvironment on the patterns of distribution of trastuzumab in primary and metastatic models.
We have observed that even when trastuzumab does have access to tumor tissues, the pattern of distribution is highly heterogeneous, similar to our previous work in a vector-overexpressing HER2-positive breast cancer model [16].
Other groups demonstrating a limitation on the accumulation of trastuzumab in preclinical tumors have focused on net tumor accumulation and suggest that a major limitation to MAb distribution is their difficulty distributing through the solid tumor tissue in the extravascular space [13, 14, 17].
In humans MAbs have a long half-life and are administered for many months.
The pharmacokinetic parameters of MAbs are therefore thought to likely accommodate relatively slow distribution of MAbs through the interstitium [14, 31].
However, our 3D tissue disc data shows trastuzumab is able to diffuse relatively well through tumor tissues in vivo in conditions of poor convective flow similar to an environment with high interstitial fluid pressure in vivo.
Neither is trastuzumab distribution limited by tight binding to antigen proximal to vessels as suggested by the binding-site barrier hypothesis [15], as it reaches distances > 150 $\mu$m from sources within 24 h despite high HER2 expression.
This distance is similar to the diffusion limit for oxygen, therefore most tumor tissues are within this 150 $\mu$m range of a blood vessel and could be expected to have adequate exposure.
These data suggest that neither the BSBH nor high interstitial fluid pressure adequately explain microregional variation in trastuzumab binding.
Given the incomplete access of trastuzumab seen in our models, other vessel- and tissue-level barriers appear to limit its distribution in the tumor microenvironment.

One barrier to MAb distribution appears to be the presence of tight junctions, labeled using ZO-1.
However, these continuous barriers are not seen in vivo where inter-vessel heterogeneity occurs and even neighboring perfused vessels exhibit dramatic differences in the amount of bound drug on their perivascular cells.
Vascular maturity and architecture has also been attributed to poor drug access [32], however, no correlation between markers for aSMA or CIV and the relative distribution of trastuzumab has been found.Higher doses and longer exposures do lead to higher numbers of vessels with perivascular trastuzumab, suggesting that some degree of intermittent perfusion or very poorly permeable vessels impact the observed microregional heterogeneity.
Non-perfused vessels have not been observed to have trastuzumab on perivascular cells, which suggests intermittent perfusion is an unlikely mechanism for observed inter-vessel heterogeneity.
Dynamic measurements of perfusion and permeability derived from DCE-MR imaging of high molecular weight contrast agent HPG-GdF (500 kDa) suggest the intuitive relationship between vascular function and drug access is important, but does not consistently explain the heterogeneous patterns of drug distribution seen.
Areas of highly perfused tissue marked by carbocyanine in histological sections correspond to areas of high perfusion and/or permeability in MRI.
However, these tumor areas of high vascular function described in both imaging modalities may or may not have bound trastuzumab.
Similarly, regions with substantial amounts of bound trastuzumab do not necessarily correspond to areas of high perfusion or permeability measured using aPS and fPV.
HPG-GdF-derived parameters fPV and aPS arise under conditions that are closer to a permeability-limited regime than standard low-molecular weight contrast agents.
However, in the highly chaotic vascular environment of tumours we can still expect these MR-derived parameters of vascular function to not be completely independent of each other.

All in vivo models investigated were found to be sensitive to the effects of bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody that binds VEGF-A and decreases vascular permeability [33].
In our xenograft studies we see a dramatic reduction in the accumulation of trastuzumab in tumors when following pre-treatment with bevacizumab.
The majority of tumor blood vessels cease to have extravasated trastuzumab bound to perivascular cells.
These detailed images of the microenvironment highlighting reduced distribution at the vessel level agree with previous studies showing average reductions in trastuzumab delivery to the whole tumor [34, 35].
In some cases VEGF ablation changes tumor vasculature, either the density or the fraction of perfused or mature vessels and the resulting overall function of tumor vasculature, but did not do so measurably in these tumors where neither the proportion of perfused vessels nor the amount of tumor hypoxia changed.

The clinical impact of combination treatments is unclear, largely due to the difficulty in measuring drug distribution directly.
Addition of bevacizumab did not improve outcomes for metastatic breast cancer patients being treated with docetaxel and trastuzumab [36].
Overall, poor clinical results have been found when combining VEGF ablation therapies with trastuzumab (reviewed in [37]).
The potential risks of combining MAbs and anti-angiogenic treatments have been recognized, and many publications and reviews in the pre-clinical and clinical fields of have called for investigations regarding optimal treatment and scheduling regimens for these combinations [37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43].

New strategies that are able to more effectively target and kill cancer cells, particularly metastatic disease, are urgently required.
Efforts to vary antigen-binding affinities and the size of MAb fragments have been explored to improve their distribution through the extravascular compartment [13, 14].
Our data highlight the importance of also considering access of antibodies to target tumor tissues and whether microregional distribution of MAb therapeutics may be affected when combined with vascular damaging agents or when targeting occult metastases.
Improvements to MAb anti-cancer activity could be made in selection of combination therapies and the design of treatment schedules, as well as in the design of novel targeted drugs.
Efforts to examine these phenomena in the clinic would be of significant interest.

\section{Conclusion}

We have shown evidence for poor distribution and access of the MAb trastuzumab in preclinical tumors through direct visualization of bound drug, with particular implications for metastatic tumors, including those of the brain.
Our data suggest that the tumor microenvironment and tissue- and vessel-level barriers to drug distribution could effectively limit access of the drug to all its target cells.
These effects appear to be more important than slow interstitial distribution resulting from high interstitial fluid pressures or high binding affinity to HER2.
Further, administering trastuzumab in combination with vascular disrupting agents could significantly impact its activity via reducing access.
