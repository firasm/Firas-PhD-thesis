   \caption{Each trace plot is the extracted ICA component corresponding to the oxygen response. The components are scored by the observer from a score of 1 to 5, with 1 barely corresponding to the oxygen challenge with a lot of noise and 5 corresponding extremely well to the oxygen challenge and very little noise. Note very few animals are in the lowest group, and many more are of extraction quality 4 and 5.}
