\chapter{Lay Summary}

In this thesis we have described the development and application of several magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques to improve our understanding of tumour in mice.
In the first part of the thesis, a new analysis method was outlined to characterize tumour blood vessels with a novel bio-compatible contrast agent.
In the second part of this thesis, we introduced, developed, validated, and applied a new method to assess tumour oxygenation using MRI.
Our technique is a significant improvement over other available methods as it uses a statistical technique to extract very small changes in MRI signal just by inhaling 100\% oxygen gas. 
We used this technique to show that treatment with a cancer drug that prunes malformed and abnormal blood vessels in tumour improves oxygenation levels.
Since our technique requires no injectable contrast agent, special sequences or hardware, we anticipate that this technique can be quickly translated into the clinic.
