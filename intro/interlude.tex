\chapter{Interlude}
\label{ch:interlude}
Through the course of the preceding work, it quickly became evident that not only is tumour oxygenation a key feature of the microenvironment, but that there is also a dearth of non-invasive techniques available to measure it.
Below we introduce some background information around the use of oxygen as a contrast agent, as well as some physiological information that may be relevant to develop a new MR-based method to assess oxygenation.
To explore the mechanism of action for the oxygen-enhanced MRI signal, it is useful to first understand the delivery of oxygen from inspired air to tissues.

% \section{Theory}
% To explore the mechanism of action for the OE-MRI signal, it is useful to first understand the delivery of oxygen from inspired air to tissues. 
% The primary mode of oxygen delivery to tissue is the haemoglobin (\acs{Hb}) molecule as it carries and delivers 98\% of the oxygen in the body. 
% Over 250 million \acs{Hb} molecules are found in a typical red blood cell and each \acs{Hb} molecule has four binding sites for oxygen molecules. 
% The binding affinity of \acs{Hb} to bind ${O_2}$ increases 

% The binding affinity for ${O_2}$ drastically increases for subsequent oxygen molecules that bind to \acs{Hb} as the conformation of the \acs{Hb} molecule changes to increase binding affinity for the next oxygen, a phenomenon called cooperativity. 
% Similarly, when the partial pressure of ${O_2}$ is lower, bound ${O_2}$ is released 

% when the local environment of the \acs{Hb} molecule changes such that ${O_2}$ needs to be released, the reverse conformational changes occur so a proportionately lower drop in oxygen tension is required to release the next ${O_2}$ molecule. 

% \section{Physiology}

% The primary mode of oxygen delivery to tissue is the haemoglobin (\acs{Hb}) molecule as it carries and delivers 98\% of the oxygen in the body. 
% Over 250 million \acs{Hb} molecules are found in a typical red blood cell and each \acs{Hb} molecule has four binding sites for oxygen molecules. 
% The binding affinity for ${O_2}$ drastically increases for subsequent oxygen molecules that bind to \acs{Hb} as the conformation of the \acs{Hb} molecule changes to increase binding affinity for the next oxygen, a phenomenon called cooperativity. 
% Similarly, when the local environment of the \acs{Hb} molecule changes such that O$_2$ needs to be released, the reverse conformational changes occur; a proportionately lower drop in oxygen tension is then required to release the next O$_2$ molecule. 
% The dissociation of oxygen from haemoglobin molecules is well described by the oxygen-haemglobin dissociation curve (figure~\ref{HBdis}).

Note that the curve is very steep in the middle but it takes a large increase in oxygen tension to bind the last O$_2$ and similarly, a large decrease in oxygen tension to release the last  O$_2$~\cite{GomezCambronero:2001hu}.}

% Upon inspiration of atmospheric air (p$_{O_2}$ = 160 mmHg), gas exchange in the pulmonary capillary beds occurs in the alveoli of the lungs (Fig~\ref{mmhg}).
% Incoming venous blood with a low oxygen tension (p$_{O_2}$ = 40 mmHg) is oxygenated as haemoglobin molecules readily bind available oxygen. 
% As the oxygenated blood leaves the alveoli and moves through the systemic arteries, it has an oxygen tension of 100 mmHg. 
% The oxygenated blood then travels from the arteries to the systemic capillary bed and the local oxygen tension drops from 100 to 40 mmHg.
% Simultaneously, while the \acs{Hb} molecule undergoes a structural change releasing a molecule of O$_2$ from its first binding site.  
% The second release of the oxygen molecule occurs when the tension drops to 26mmHg~\cite{GomezCambronero:2001hu}. 
% The third and fourth molecules are released with consecutively smaller drops in oxygen tension as low oxygen tension indicates an oxygen starved environment. This important feature of \acs{Hb} (cooperativity) ensures that small changes in p$_{O_2}$ have the appropriate effect in the appropriate place. 
% For instance, in the lung tight binding is required so \acs{Hb} can bind the O$_2$ needed to supply all the tissues.
% Therefore, small changes should not affect the release of O$_2$.
% Conversely, small changes in p$_{O_2}$ in capillary beds should result in quick release of O$_2$ so it can easily diffuse to oxygen-starved tissues. 
% Practically however, it is important to note that \acs{Hb} molecules never release all four of the bound oxygen.

% \section{Origin of the OE-MRI Signal}

% Oxygen is a paramagnetic molecule because it has two unpaired electrons and it is widely reported that the dominating effect in the OE-MRI signal is a T$_1$ decrease after concentrated oxygen gas (100\% O$_2$) is breathed in~\cite{OConnor:2016ee,Linnik:2013hf}. 
% The excess oxygen travels through the blood stream dissolved in plasma and diffuses through the vessel walls and dissolves in interstitial tissue fluid (figure~\ref{oemri}).
% The net increase in dissolved oxygen results in a dramatic and measurable decrease in T$_1$. 
% This change is reversed soon after the patient is switched back to breathing atmospheric air as excess oxygen is expelled or metabolized. 
% Perfused tumour regions (i.e regions that already have a high \acs{Hb}-O$_2$ saturation) will see a measurable decrease in T$_1$. 
% The perfused regions that do not show a decrease in T$_1$ must therefore be hypoxic~\cite{OConnor:2016ee}. 
% Importantly, OE-MRI does not yield any information about unperfused regions and in that region, there are likely to be pockets of viable (but hypoxic) tissue.

% The oxygen status of healthy tissue is fairly well regulated in normal tissue and every cell in the body is at most 150$\mu$m away from a blood vessel. 
% In tumours however, the vascular network is chaotic and the growth patterns of vessels are abnormal leading to a defective and leaky endothelium~\cite{McDonald:2002ut}. 
% Irregular diameters of tumour vessels, abnormal branching patterns and leaky vessel walls all contribute to an increase in vessel permeability and pockets of hypoxic tissue. 
% Unfortunately in hypoxic tissue the oxygen status cannot be well characterized as many factors can influence the oxygen dissociation curve including temperature, pH, and carbon dioxide concentration - all factors that persist unregulated in tumour hypoxic tissue. 
% Furthermore, these hypoxic regions are heterogeneous, transient, and drastically differ between tumour models. 
% Thanks to some excellent work with spectral imaging using an implanted window chamber in mice, it is known that upon breathing 100\% oxygen, the \acs{Hb} saturation in the tumour vascular network increases from 20-30\% up to 70-80\% while the \acs{Hb} saturation in the normal vascular network does not change appreciably~\cite{Sorg:2008eg}.
% \SARi{I would present this as a tentative model that we have. You can update the picture to show some of our most recent refinments in the understanding ...}

% \todo{Should probably discuss whether this (admittedly flawed) picture of our understanding should still be included, or the waterton figure re-created}

% 		\caption{A schematic representation of the origin of the OEMRI effect. In normoxic tissue, \acs{Hb} is almost fully saturated and any excess breathed O$_2$ cannot bind to the \acs{Hb} molecule. Consequently, O$_2$ dissolves in the blood plasma and as the excess oxygen diffuses out into the tissue, it also dissolves in the interstitial tissue fluid resulting in a net T$_1$ decrease. It is hypothesized that in the hypoxic tissue, \acs{Hb} is not fully saturated with oxygen due to increased tissue demands and/or a poorly organized vascular network. The excess breathed oxygen in this case binds to the \acs{Hb} molecule and does \textbf{not} dissolve in the plasma leading to no change in T$_1$.}
