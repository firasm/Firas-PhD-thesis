\chapter{Interlude}
\label{ch:interlude}
Through the course of the preceding work, it quickly became evident that not only is tumour oxygenation a key feature of the microenvironment, but that there is also a dearth of non-invasive techniques available to measure it.
Below we introduce some background information around the use of oxygen as a contrast agent, as well as some physiological information that may be relevant to develop a new MR-based method to assess oxygenation.
To explore the mechanism of action for the oxygen-enhanced MRI signal, it is useful to first understand the delivery of oxygen from inspired air to tissues.
